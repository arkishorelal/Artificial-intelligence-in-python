# Text to speech using python

A text-to-speech system is designed to convert written text into spoken words. It utilizes artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques to generate human-like speech. The primary goal of a text-to-speech project is to enable a computer program or device to communicate with users through spoken language.

Explanation: 

This project is built using python. In this project, at first it will recognize our voice accordingly it will analyse and based on that it will produce the result.
The voice recognition component recognizes and analyzes the user's voice input. Then, using artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques, the program processes the input and generates an appropriate response in spoken language.
